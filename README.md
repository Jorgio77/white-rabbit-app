# white-rabbit-app

My first react-native project

Dating app that connect people that want to go on the same events

Ejected from expo to use the react-native-firebase library

The app uses Redux to manage the state and Firebase as database

The app uses legacy code with just classes, working during my sparetime to refactor the code and move to functional components + hooks
